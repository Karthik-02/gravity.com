# Objective:
To create a simple one page web app using ReactJs / NextJs.
● The app takes location inputs of "Origin" & "Destination" and then plots the route
on maps along with distance.
● There’s an option for users to add multiple stops on the route - when a user adds a
stop, it becomes a waypoint between Origin & Destination. Adding stops is optional
● Input validation - Origin & Destination inputs should fetch location from Google
maps autosuggest. Users should not be able to add anything else.
